# TicTacToeLocal

The repository contains the project which I did for my university's classes.

## How to start app
It was run on Ubuntu 22.04 and using Python 3.8.

Install Docker.
Go to the folder with this repository and run:
```
$ \path\to\this\repo> docker compose up
```

This command will build the docker images and run apps.

Then go to http://localhost:8000 in your browser and start using the app.
Next player can join using the same url and selecting different name.
